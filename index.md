# Who are you? 

I'm just another person on this world, living on the edge of everything and hope to create more hope in this world full of darkness. 
My life have been full of events and moments that I want to remember forever, but I decided to not live in the past. 

## What is Suraimu?

Suraimu (スライム) is a japanese fantasy magical creature made out of a permeable membrane, and filled with magical matter called magicules. 
In some of the mythos (such as Tensura) the Suraimu art are unique and seem to be adaptable to all environmental changes, gaining great possiblity to live under any condition. 

My character design is a light-class Suraimu which choose to burn the inner matter (magicules) to proivide shine in the darkness of the earth forest. 

## Who is Arts?

Arts is a joined name of myself and Arts Epiphany, a brilliant girl who decided to end her life in exchange of raining visibility of the conditions of the transgender community. 

Arts E and myself shares this name as part of our joint wish.

## Teaching
I am also guest lecturer at [Technical University of Munich](www.tum.de), School of Computation, Information and Technology. I frequently teach about computer architecture, GPU programming, parallel programming and related topics at difference lecture and practical courses at TUM. 

Stay tuned for upcoming lecture notes and time.

# Education

I hold a PhD degree in Informatics from Technical University of Munich. 

I speak 4 languages, out of which 3 are professional: Chinese Mandarin, German, English. I also understand and speak a little bit of Japanese. 

I don't program much any more being an architect. I use to program in C/C++.

# Charity

I donate to many charity organizations and support people who needs help. 

I am a proud member of German Society of Transidentity and Intersexuality (Deutsche Gesellschaft für Transidentität und Intersexualität e.V. ).

Some donation until  went to:

- [German Society of Transidentity and Intersexuality (dgti e.V.)](https://dgti.org)
- [Bavarian Red Cross](https://brk.de)
